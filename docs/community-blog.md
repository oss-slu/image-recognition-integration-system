## What's IRIS?

In the fast-moving world of artificial intelligence, image recognition remains one of the most impactful yet fragmented fields. Every year, new models, datasets, and architectures emerge, but for data scientists and developers working in teams, integrating and comparing these models often feels like reinventing the wheel.

That’s where **IRIS (Image Recognition Integration System)** comes in.

IRIS is an open-source framework designed to simplify how teams plug in, test, and deploy image recognition models in a unified environment. Instead of building from scratch, IRIS provides a modular backend where contributors can integrate their models seamlessly which accelerates research, collaboration, and reproducibility.

## Why IRIS?

Modern AI projects often face challenges like:

- Fragmented development environments
- Model integration difficulties
- Limited collaboration between data scientists and engineers

IRIS solves these by providing a modular architecture where anyone can:

- Upload or connect their **image recognition models**
- Test them using standardized datasets
- Contribute improvements and utilities through GitHub

In short, IRIS is **“for the community, by the community.”**

## Current Progress

In the last few sprints, our contributors have:

- Implemented foundational features such as **IndexedDB image storage**
- Set up a **frontend gallery view** for image upload and retrieval
- Built early versions of **API integration layers** for model inference
- Improved our **code review and branching process**

We’re currently focusing on performance improvements including optimizing image loading, caching, and responsive rendering to ensure a smoother user experience.

## How You Can Contribute

IRIS thrives on collaboration! Whether you're a developer, designer, or AI researcher, there’s a place for you.

Here are some ways to get started:

- Star and fork the [IRIS repository](https://github.com/oss-slu/image-recognition-integration-system)
- Browse our [open issues](https://github.com/oss-slu/image-recognition-integration-system/issues) — look for tags like `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- Join our **Slack workspace** for discussions and pairing sessions
- Review and comment on ongoing [Pull Requests](https://github.com/oss-slu/image-recognition-integration-system/pulls)
- Help improve our documentation or create demos

No contribution is too small, every issue you review, comment you leave, or PR you merge strengthens our community.

## 🌱 Our Growing Community

We’ve seen encouraging signs of growth:

- Students are learning real-world workflows (branching, PR reviews, CI/CD).
- Discussions on GitHub and Slack are shaping the next stages of IRIS development.

Still, we’re learning that true community building requires consistent engagement. Regular check-ins, shared demos, and mentorship make open source thrive.

That’s what we’re focusing on in the coming sprints.

## What’s Next

In the next development cycle, we aim to:

- Merge core features such as **authentication** and **image optimization**
- Launch a **live demo site** powered by GitHub Pages
- Host our **first community review meeting**
- Publish contributor guides and video walkthroughs

If you’re passionate about computer vision, open collaboration, or educational AI systems — **we would love to have you join us**.

## Final Thoughts

IRIS started as a class project, but it’s growing into something much bigger, a living ecosystem for AI practitioners to experiment, learn, and contribute together. We invite you to be part of that journey.
