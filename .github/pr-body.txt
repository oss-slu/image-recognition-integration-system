Accessibility improvements to make the app more usable by screen reader and keyboard-only users.

What changed
- Added ARIA labels for navigation links and key buttons
- Added a "Skip to content" link and made the site content focusable (`LayoutShell`)
- Improved modal accessibility (role="dialog", aria-modal, Escape-to-close, autofocus, restore focus)
- Login form: associated labels, aria-required, accessible buttons
- Replaced invalid Tailwind classnames (size-*) with standard w-/h- utilities
- Fixed a merge conflict in `app/imageGallery/page.tsx`
- Unit tests passed locally

Checklist
- [ ] Manual smoke test (navigate via keyboard)
- [ ] Run automated axe scan (recommended)
- [ ] Consider adding focus-trap-react for complex modals (follow-up)
